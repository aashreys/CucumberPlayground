 * This class configures the Cucumber test framework and Java glue code
 *
 * Flavors' support: When you have multiple flavors the best configuration is to follow this steps:
 * 1- Create a copy of this file on each flavor's specific test package and delete the original file
 *      i.e. androidTestFlavor/java/com/neoranga55/cleanguitestarchitecture/test/CucumberTestCase.java
 * 2- Modify the original report path to include the flavor /mnt/sdcard/cucumber-reports/FLAVOR/cucumber-html-report
 * 3- Tag your scenarios in the feature files with new specific tags for each flavor and include them in the flavor's version of this file
 *      i.e. Add tag @flavor-one to a test scenario and modify the flavor's CucumberTestCase.java with tags={"~@manual", "@flavor-one"}
